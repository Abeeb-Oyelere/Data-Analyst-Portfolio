## Project 1: Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was given a dataset including data from an experiment. I employed statistical approaches to address data questions and report my findings and suggestions. In this project, I analyze one of Udacity's curated datasets using NumPy and pandas. I perform the full data analysis process, beginning with analytical questions and ending with sharing of my findings.

## Project 2: Data Wrangling and Analysis with Tweet WeRateDogs data
Subjects Covered:

* GATHERING DATA:
Collect data from a variety of sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, online scraping data, and API access.
Import data into pandas in a variety of file types, including flat files (e.g., TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files.

* ASSESSING DATA
Using pandas, I evaluate data visually and programmatically.
I distinguish between dirty data ("quality problems") and messy data ("tidiness issues").
I identify data quality concerns using criteria such as validity, correctness, completeness, consistency, and uniformity.

* CLEANING DATA
Identify each stage in the data cleansing procedure (defining, coding,and testing)
Python and pandas is used to clean data.
Python is used to test cleaned code both visually and programmatically

## Project 3: Data Visulization with Diamond Data
Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

## Project 4: Data Visualization with Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
I utilized Python's data visualization capabilities in this project to methodically investigate the bike dataset for attributes and correlations between variables. Then I built a presentation to share my results with others.
