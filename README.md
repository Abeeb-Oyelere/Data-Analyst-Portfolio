## Project 1: Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report. In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings.

## Project 2: Data Wrangling and Analysis with Tweet WeRateDogs data
Subjects Covered:

* GATHERING DATA:
Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs
Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database
* ASSESSING DATA
Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
* CLEANING DATA
Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
Clean data using Python and pandas
Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python

## Project 3: Data Visulization with Diamond Data
Data visualization to a dataset involving the characteristics of diamonds and their prices.

## Project 4: Data Visualization with Communicate data finding with Ford Go Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I used Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore the bike dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, I created a presentation that communicates the findings to others.
